```{r setup, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(cyCONDOR)
```

In this vignette we showcase `cyCONDOR` functions for clustering and cell annotation.

# Load example cyCONDOR object
```{r}
condor <- readRDS("../.test_files/condor_example.rds")
#condor <- readRDS("/data/analysis/data/.test_files/condor_example.rds")
```

The `cyCONDOR` ecosystem provides different clustering methods, Phenograph and FlowSOM. It also provides a convenient way to assign cell annotations to the clustered object.

The clustering functions take the `condor` object as `fcd` input and the matrix to be used for the calculation of the clusters as `data_slot` input (e.g. `orig` or `norm`). We recommend using the PCA coordinates as `input_type` to compensate for fluctuations in the expression data. By defining a `prefix` which gets incorporated into the slot name of the output, each function can be run with different settings and the results will be saved accordingly. The functions return a fcd with an additional data frame corresponding to the calculated clustering saved in `fcd$clustering`. The name of the output consists of the `prefix` (if given), the clustering method and the `data_slot`.

Additionally, the user has the option to specifically state which markers should be used for the calculation by listing them under `markers`. The list can be either written out manually or be extracted directly from the `condor` object using the implemented functions `measured_markers` and `used_markers` By default all available markers from the condor object are used. If the `discard` option is set to TRUE, all markers **except** the ones listed under `markers` are used for calculation. This enables the exclusion of single markers.

# Phenograph clustering

`runPhenograph` is based on the package `Rphenoannoy`, an optimized version of `Rphenograph`. This clustering method is designed for high-dimensional single-cell data analysis incorporating the approximate k-nearest neighbor (kNN) technique for graph construction. The `k` parameter defines the number of nearest neighbors to be used for the nearest-neighbor graph, with higher values resulting in fewer clusters. It can be useful to try out different settings here to get the desired cluster resolution. A seed can be set to ensure reproducibility of the clustering.

```{r}
condor <- runPhenograph(fcd = condor, 
                        input_type = "pca", 
                        data_slot = "orig", 
                        k = 60, 
                        seed = 91)
```
The output of the phenograph clustering can be accessed with `condor$clustering$phenograph_pca_orig_k_60`.

# FlowSOM clustering

`runFlowSOM` provides a fast algorithm to cluster a high number of cells. The `nClusters` parameter defines the final number of clusters to be generated. A seed can be set to ensure reproducibility of the clustering.

For more details see: Van Gassen S et al. (2015) "FlowSOM: Using self-organizing maps for visualization and interpretation of cytometry data." Cytom Part J Int Soc Anal Cytol 87: 636-645. <https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/cyto.a.22625>

```{r}
condor <- runFlowSOM(fcd = condor, 
                     input_type = "pca", 
                     data_slot = "orig", 
                     nClusters = 15, 
                     seed = 91, 
                     ret_model = TRUE)
```
The output of the FlowSOM clustering can be accessed with `condor$clustering$FlowSOM_pca_orig_k_60`.



# Metaclustering

Each cluster can be now labeled according to the specific cell type with the `metaclustering` function. This function takes the condor object (`fcd`) and the `cluster_slot` as input. The `cluster_var_new` parameter names the new column containing the cell types. The `metacluster` parameter is a named vector acting as translation table to annotate each cell cluster.

```{r}
condor <- metaclustering(fcd = condor, 
                         cluster_slot = "Phenograph_pca_orig_k_60", 
                         cluster_var = "Phenograph",
